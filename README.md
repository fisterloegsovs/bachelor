# How to use Why3 CLI

```why3 prove -P <prover> program.mlw```

For example if we want to prove the program find.mlw we could write:
```why3 prove -P alt-ergo find.mlw```

There are multiple provers, some of them are alt-ergo, z3 and cvc4 all of which can be installed using the opam package manager
